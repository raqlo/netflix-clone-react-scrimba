## Reflection

This was a side project created to experiment with Firebase using a Scrimba tutorial as a guide. Sadly, Scrimba deprecated the course because of the release of the new Firebase version 9, which is not compatible with the previous versions.  So I decided to continue with this project but to adapt it to the new version as the same time I familiarize with the library.
